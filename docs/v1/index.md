## Introduction

`DefineTFBindingSites.from.PFM` uses the Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) from JASPAR for a transcription factor of interest to score every possible k-mer of a length k. The k-mer with the maximum score that conforms to the IUPAC definition of a binding site is normalized to 1.0 and all other k-mers are normalized relative to that score. For example, a normalized value of 0.1 is 10% of the maximum score. 

## Methodology

The raw PFM dataset for a transcription factor is downloaded from [JASPAR](https://jaspar.elixir.no/) and converted to a Position Weight Matrix (PWM). The first step in this conversion is optionally adding pseucdocounts to each value in the matrix. Then, the sum of the entire matrix is taken and divided by the number of columns to obtain the average sum of a column in the matrix. Each value in the matrix is divided by this average sum of a column value. Finally, the PWM is generated by performing the following calculation for each value in the matrix: log2(value / background frequency of the nucleotide). 

Next, every possible k-mer is obtained, where k is the length of the binding site definition. The score for every k-mer can be calculated using this PWM. For each nucleotide in the k-mer, obtain the corresponding value contained in the PWM at that position and for that particular nucleotide. Repeat this process for all nucleotides in the k-mer and take the sum of all values to obtain the score.

Lastly, the scores must be normalized. The user defines the minimal binding site using IUPAC nomenclature (ie, N = ATGC, W = AT, [etc](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/iupac.html)). The tool searches for the k-mer with the highest score that conforms to the IUPAC binding site definition. For all other k-mers, the score will be normalized relative to the score of the maximum k-mer and the resulting value is called the relative score. Therefore, the k-mer with the maximum score will have a relative affinity of 1.0. The normalization calculation for each k-mer is: relative score = (score) / (score of the maximum IUPAC k-mer). 

## Parameters

### Inputs and Outputs

- <span style="color: red;">*</span> **raw JASPAR PFM (.tsv)** 
    - Position Frequency Matrix from JASPAR. 
- <span style="color: red;">*</span>**reference relative score table output filename (.tsv)**
    - Name of the output file containing the normalized PFM data. 
- <span style="color: red;">*</span>**histograms of relative scores output filename (.png)** 
    - Name of the output graph containing 3 histogram plots of the normalized scores.
      
### Other Parameters
- <span style="color: red;">*</span>**binding site definition (string)**
    - IUPAC definition of the core transcription factor binding site (see [here](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html)). The length of the IUPAC definition should be the same length k as the k-mers in the raw PBM file.
- <span style="color: red;">*</span>**background frequency of A,C,G,T (comma-separated string)**
    - `Default = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`
    - Frequencies defining the background model, which contains the probability of each nucleotide being randomly generated. 
- <span style="color: red;">*</span>**pseudocount values (comma-separated string)**
    - `Default = None`
    - Increase each value in the matrix by a certain value to avoid null values.
- **report sites only (boolean)**
    - `Default = False`
    - If `True`, only report k-mers abiding by the binding site definition. If `False`, report all k-mers.
- **enforce minimum relative score (boolean)**
    - `Default = False`
    - If True, enforce the scores to range between 0 and 1. If False, the original range of scores will remain the same.
- **define highest relative score aequence (string)**
    - `Default = None`
    - The k-mer sequence whose score will be used to normalize the scores of all other k-mers. The relative score for this k-mer will be 1.0. 

## Warnings Printed:

1. If there exists another k-mer that conforms to the binding site definition and has a higher score than one provided by the user as the **Max K-mer to Normalize**.
2. If there are any k-mers that do not conform to the binding site definition but have a score greater than the k-mer provided by the user. The affinities of all non-IUPAC kmers with a higher score will be capped at 1.0.
